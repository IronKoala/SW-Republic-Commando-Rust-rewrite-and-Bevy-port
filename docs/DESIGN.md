# How the project works

Plain-language notes on the design. Updated when the shape of something changes.

## Layout

The code is a Cargo "workspace": several small Rust libraries and programs
("crates") in `crates/`, built together. The idea comes from IW4L and benilla.

| Crate | What it does |
|---|---|
| `rc_package` | Reads Unreal Engine 2 packages from bytes it's given. Opens no files. No Bevy. |
| `rc_image` | Turns raw pixel data (P8, DXT1/3/5, RGBA8, G16) into plain RGBA pictures and writes PNG files. Knows nothing about Unreal. No Bevy. |
| `rc_probe` | Small command-line tool that opens packages from the game folder and logs what it read. |

Format readers stay plain Rust with no Bevy in them, so they can be tested alone.
Bevy will come in later as a separate crate that uses them.

## Finding the game

The game folder comes from the `RC_GAME_DIR` environment variable, or defaults to
`C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Republic Commando`. Programs only ever
read from it. Logs go to `logs/` in the folder you run from, which `.gitignore`
never tracks.

## Unreal packages

Every game data file (`.u` scripts, `.ctm` maps, `.utx` textures, `.uax` sounds,
`.usx` static meshes, `.ukx` animations) is an Unreal "package":

1. **Header** (64 bytes in this game): the magic number `C1 83 2A 9E`, the version,
   and where the three tables are.
2. **Name table**: every name used in the file (like `Core`, `Vector`, `ScriptText`).
   Everything else refers to names by their number in this list.
3. **Import table**: objects this package uses from other packages.
4. **Export table**: objects stored in this package, each with its class, name and
   the byte range of its data.

Object references are one number: positive means "export number N-1", negative
means "import number -N-1", zero means none.

Many numbers are stored as a "compact index": a variable-length integer of 1 to 5
bytes, small numbers take 1 byte.

### What's special in Republic Commando

The stored version has two halves: the package version (low 16 bits) and a
"licensee" version that the game studio sets (high 16 bits). Republic Commando
uses licensee version 1. A full scan of the Steam install (273 packages) found
package versions 130 to 159 with licensee 1, mostly 157-159. Three odd files
use other engines' versions (99 and 106 with licensee 0, and 121 with licensee
28); they still read fine with the standard UE2 layout.

From package version 151, the export table layout differs from standard UE2
(found by UE Viewer):

- Data size and offset are plain 4-byte numbers, always present, instead of
  compact indexes.
- From version 159 there is one extra compact index after the package index.
  Its meaning is unknown; in `Core.u` it is 0 for the exports we looked at.

Older packages (135-145) use the standard UE2 layout. Both are handled, and both
were tested on real files.

### How we know the reading is right

`Package::check()` checks every name is readable text, every reference points
inside the tables, every export's data lies inside the file, and the header's
"generation" counts match. In `Core.u` the first export's data starts at exactly
the byte where the export table ends, which is what we expect if the table was
read correctly.

## Object data: properties

Most objects' data starts with a list of "properties", the settings you'd see in
the Unreal editor (for a texture: `Format`, `USize`, `VSize`, `Palette`, ...).
Each one is the property's name, one info byte (type, size, array flag) and the
value. The list ends with the name `None`. `rc_package::properties` reads it and
decodes the simple types (byte, int, bool, float, object, name); the rest keep
their raw bytes for now.

## Textures

After the properties, a `Texture` stores its mipmaps: the picture at full size,
then half size, quarter size, and so on. Each mipmap is a "skip position" (the
file offset just after its pixels), the pixel bytes, the width and height, and
two small numbers (log2 of width and height). `rc_package::texture` reads them.

Three checks show the reading is right, and all pass on real files:
- The skip position equals where the pixels really end.
- The byte count matches what the format needs (DXT1 uses 8 bytes per 4x4
  block, DXT3/DXT5 16, P8 one byte per pixel, RGBA8 four).
- Nothing is left over at the end of the object.

Formats are UE2's numbers: 0 P8 (8-bit with a separate palette), 3 DXT1,
7 DXT3, 8 DXT5, 5 RGBA8, 10 G16 (terrain heightmaps). Republic Commando also
uses 12 and 14, both 2 bytes per pixel (measured on every mipmap). UE Viewer
guesses 14 is CxV8U8, a two-channel format used for bump maps. We found no name
for 12.

Known quirk: `MP_Trando_Light_Cluster` (in `multiplayer_textures.utx`) stores
its last mipmap, 1x1 pixels, with 0 bytes. The file is otherwise consistent, so
this seems to be how the game shipped. The check reports it rather than hiding
it.

## From texture bytes to pictures

`rc_image` turns a mipmap's bytes into RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha; 4 bytes
per pixel):

- **P8**: each byte picks one of 256 colours from the texture's `Palette`
  object (256 colours stored red, green, blue, alpha). If `bMasked` is set,
  colour 0 is see-through.
- **RGBA8**: stored blue, green, red, alpha, so the first and third bytes swap.
- **DXT1/3/5**: the picture is cut into 4x4 squares. Each square stores two
  colours and picks between them and two in-between colours per pixel. DXT3
  adds 4 bits of alpha per pixel; DXT5 adds an alpha pair with 8 steps.
- **G16**: 16-bit grey; we keep the top 8 bits.

PNG files are written uncompressed (simplest valid PNG), so they're large but
open anywhere. They go to `extracted/textures/<package>/<texture>.png`.

**How we check pictures without looking at them.** Each texture stores its own
half-size copy (mip 1), made by the game's tools. We shrink our decoded full-
size picture (mip 0) by averaging 2x2 squares and compare it with our decoded
mip 1. Correct decoding gives a small difference; unrelated pictures of the same
size differ by about 57 out of 255 on average (measured on 524 pairs). Results
across the install: 1,916 of 2,003 textures differ by under 10; 17 by over 20.
The 17 are mostly fine patterns (grates, noise, flickering screens). Their
smaller copies fade toward flat grey, which suggests the artists made those
mipmaps differently. That explanation is a guess and hasn't been checked by eye.
