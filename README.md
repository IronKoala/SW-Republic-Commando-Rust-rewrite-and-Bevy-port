# Star Wars: Republic Commando, rewritten in Rust

A from-scratch Rust rewrite of Star Wars: Republic Commando (2005), aiming to run on
the Bevy game engine. It reads the game's data from **your own installed copy** at
runtime. Single-player and offline only.

**This repository contains no game content.** No textures, maps, sounds, models,
scripts or decompiled code are included, and none ever will be. You need your own
copy of the game.

## What works

- **Reading game packages (tested).** `rc_probe` opens any of the game's package
  files (`.u .ctm .utx .uax .usx .ukx`) read-only and reads the header, the name
  table, the import table and the export table. Tested on Windows against a full
  Steam install: all 273 packages read and passed every consistency check, in
  under one second.

- **Reading textures (partly tested).** `rc_probe --textures` reads every `Texture`
  object: its settings (format, size) and the raw pixel data of each mipmap.
  Tested on all 57 texture packages from the install plus the script packages and
  three maps: 2,491 textures, 2,490 pass every check. The one exception is a
  texture whose smallest (1x1) mipmap is stored with no pixels, which looks like
  a quirk in the game's own file. Formats seen: P8, DXT1, DXT3, DXT5, RGBA8,
  G16, and two 2-byte-per-pixel formats numbered 12 and 14.

- **Turning textures into pictures (tested by numbers, not by eye).** The
  `rc_image` crate decodes P8 (with its palette), DXT1, DXT3, DXT5, RGBA8 and G16
  into normal colours, and `rc_probe --export-textures` saves them as PNG files
  in the gitignored `extracted/textures/` folder. Of 2,491 textures, 2,358 were
  decoded with no failures. For 2,003 of them we could compare against the
  game's own half-size copy, and 1,916 match within 10 out of 255.

## What doesn't work yet

- Formats 12 and 14 (133 textures, probably bump maps) aren't decoded.
- Nothing is shown on screen yet; there is no Bevy window.
- Not tested yet: textures stored inside the 76 maps that weren't sampled, and the
  texture scan on Windows (run in the cloud sandbox on copies of the files).
- Other objects (meshes, sounds, level geometry, scripts) are not decoded yet.
- No Bevy, no window, no game yet.

## How to run it

You need Rust (install from <https://rustup.rs>). From this folder:

```
cargo run --release -p rc_probe
```

This opens `GameData\System\Core.u` from the game folder and logs what's inside.
To check every package in the game:

```
cargo run --release -p rc_probe -- "C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Republic Commando\GameData"
```

To read every texture in the game:

```
cargo run --release -p rc_probe -- --textures
```

This logs to `logs\rc_textures.log` and ends with a `--- texture summary ---` line.
To save one package's textures as pictures you can open:

```
cargo run --release -p rc_probe -- --export-textures "C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Republic Commando\GameData\Textures\weapontextures.utx"
```

The PNGs go to `extracted\textures\weapontextures\`, which git never tracks.

If your game is somewhere else, set `RC_GAME_DIR` first, for example
`set RC_GAME_DIR=D:\Games\Star Wars Republic Commando`.

Results go to the screen and to `logs\rc_probe.log`. The program only reads the
game folder and refuses to run from inside it.
