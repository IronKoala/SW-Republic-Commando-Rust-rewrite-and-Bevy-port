# Star Wars: Republic Commando, rewritten in Rust

A from-scratch Rust rewrite of Star Wars: Republic Commando (2005), aiming to run on
the Bevy game engine. It reads the game's data from **your own installed copy** at
runtime. Single-player and offline only.

**This repository contains no game content.** No textures, maps, sounds, models,
scripts or decompiled code are included, and none ever will be. You need your own
copy of the game.

## What works

- **Reading game packages (tested).** `rc_probe` opens any of the game's package
  files (`.u .ctm .utx .uax .usx .ukx`) read-only and reads the header, the name
  table, the import table and the export table. Tested on Windows against a full
  Steam install: all 273 packages read and passed every consistency check, in
  under one second.

## What doesn't work yet

- The contents of objects (textures, meshes, sounds, level geometry, scripts) are
  not decoded yet. Only the tables that list them are read.
- No Bevy, no window, no game yet.

## How to run it

You need Rust (install from <https://rustup.rs>). From this folder:

```
cargo run --release -p rc_probe
```

This opens `GameData\System\Core.u` from the game folder and logs what's inside.
To check every package in the game:

```
cargo run --release -p rc_probe -- "C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Republic Commando\GameData"
```

If your game is somewhere else, set `RC_GAME_DIR` first, for example
`set RC_GAME_DIR=D:\Games\Star Wars Republic Commando`.

Results go to the screen and to `logs\rc_probe.log`. The program only reads the
game folder and refuses to run from inside it.
